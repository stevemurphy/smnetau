This is the first iteration of my 'new' website, built with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). In fact it's only the jekyll platform that is new -- the content so far comes from previous posts on some other sites I've run in the past. Some of it is quite old and irrelevant. New stuff might come one day, but I am a very infrequent blogger.

Oh, and although everything seems to work, the design is pretty ordinary. Will work on that one day, too.

In the meantime, I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine why using Jekyll is a good idea (hint: Google is your friend).
