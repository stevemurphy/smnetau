# This is the data and code for my jekyll blog

By running [Jekyll](:http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) on my local repository the contents of these folders are turned into a static web site.

I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine why using Jekyll is a good idea (hint: Google is your friend).
